# Data-Mapping

The objective of this project is to design a model to search for common research areas between disciplinnes based on key words in published articles

A python code is provided as well as the data.csv used to get the results

The data.csv file contains a matrix of keywords in published articles by professors at York University, Toronto, Canada, in the International Studies and Philosophy departments

The research process outline is also provided

Note: The data set can get very large and hence, it is better to deal with smaller data or run this program on a powerful computer
